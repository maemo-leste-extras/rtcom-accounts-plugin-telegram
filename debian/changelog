rtcom-accounts-plugin-telegram (1.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release
  * Currently one cannot link an account yet as the dialog requesting the pin
    does not show, so this needs to be done in purple first
  * Also, apparmor will currently get in the way of telepathy-haze being able
    to access the ~/.local/share/tdlib directory.
